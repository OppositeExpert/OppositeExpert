# Hi — I'm Pranav Prabhu 👋

**Engineering student • Analyst • Networking & Tech Consulting Enthusiast**

I build secure, data-driven tools and network labs that solve real problems. I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights, designing reliable networks, and presenting technical work in a business-context that non-technical stakeholders can act on.

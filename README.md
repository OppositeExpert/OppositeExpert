# Hi — I'm Pranav Prabhu 👋

**Engineering student • Analyst • Networking & Tech Consulting Enthusiast**

I build secure, data-driven tools and network labs that solve real problems. I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights, designing reliable networks, and presenting technical work in a business-context that non-technical stakeholders can act on.

---

## Focus areas

* **Data & Analytics:** Python, Pandas, SQL, Tableau/Streamlit — analytics, forecasting, dashboards.
* **Networking & Infra:** Cisco Packet Tracer labs, VLANs, OSPF, HSRP, L2/L3 design, wired & wireless integration.
* **Secure Software:** Flask APIs, JWT, AES encryption, homomorphic encryption (Paillier) for privacy-preserving analytics.
* **Consulting Mindset:** Problem scoping, business justification, clean documentation, reproducible demos.

## Highlight projects

* **secure-bank-dashboard** — *Secure full-stack financial dashboard* (Flask, Streamlit, MySQL). AES encryption for sensitive data, JWT auth, and Paillier homomorphic encryption to compute aggregate analytics without exposing individual data. (Demo + screenshots in repo)

---

## Skills & tools

**Languages:** Python, SQL, Bash
**Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Streamlit, Tableau
**Networking:** Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, VLANs, OSPF, HSRP, fiber basics
**Dev / Infra:** Flask, Docker (planned), Git, CI ideas (GitHub Actions)
**Security:** AES, JWT, homomorphic encryption (Paillier), basic secure-by-design practices

---

## Quick wins I can demo

* Secure analytics (homomorphic sum/average without decrypting user data)
* End-to-end network design for 3-floor enterprise with config files and verification steps
* Data story from raw CSV → cleaned dataset → dashboard with insights & forecasts

---

## What I'm looking for

Roles / internships in **Data Analytics**, **Network Engineering**, or **Technology Consulting** — where I can combine technical implementation with business impact.
